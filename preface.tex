The preface in a report is something that comes before the report. This section will typically set up the stage for whatever your report is going to discuss. It may give some background information on the subject.

Normally a preface it will be a three paragraph length answer. The first paragraph should be explaining what you are investigating and why. the second should be the scope of your investigation. the third should be the conclusion that your investigation brought you to.

If your report does not have any preface, you may remove it from your latex.
