abstract="The reliable road network plays a vital role in many applications. Owing to the development of remote sensing technology and the success of deep learning in computer vision, automatic road extraction from remote sensing images is a research hotspot in recent years. However, due to the complicated image background and special road structure, the results of automatic road extraction are still far from perfect. In this paper, we propose a road segmentation network that is designed based on improved U-Net, which contains an encoder and a decoder. First, the recurrent criss-cross attention module (CCA) is introduced into the encoder to obtain long-range contextual dependencies with a relatively small number of computations and parameters, which results in better understanding and expression of image information. Second, we propose the attention-based multi-scale feature fusion module (AMS) to resolve the problem of different shapes and widths of the roads, which is placed between the encoder and decoder and uses attention mechanisms to guide multi-scale information fusion. Experimental on the Massachusetts Roads Dataset show that the proposed method achieves better performance in road extraction than other methods in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.",

abstract = {Semantic segmentation, also called scene labeling, refers to the process of assigning a semantic label (e.g. car, people, and road) to each pixel of an image. It is an essential data processing step for robots and other unmanned systems to understand the surrounding scene. Despite decades of efforts, semantic segmentation is still a very challenging task due to large variations in natural scenes. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of recent advances in this field. In particular, three categories of methods are reviewed and compared, including those based on hand-engineered features, learned features and weakly supervised learning. In addition, we describe a number of popular datasets aiming for facilitating the development of new segmentation algorithms. In order to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of different semantic segmentation models, we conduct a series of comparisons between them. Deep discussions about the comparisons are also provided. Finally, this review is concluded by discussing future directions and challenges in this important field of research.}

@article{SIFT,
  abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

abstract = {Few-shot segmentation aims to learn a segmentation model that can be generalized to novel classes with only a few training images. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Reference and Local–Global Conditional Networks (CRCNet) for few-shot segmentation. Unlike previous works that only predict the query image’s mask, our proposed model concurrently makes predictions for both the support image and the query image. Our network can better find the co-occurrent objects in the two images with a cross-reference mechanism, thus helping the few-shot segmentation task. To further improve feature comparison, we develop a local-global conditional module to capture both global and local relations. We also develop a mask refinement module to refine the prediction of the foreground regions recurrently. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012, MS COCO, and FSS-1000 datasets show that our network achieves new state-of-the-art performance.},

abstract = {Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images often faces complex situations, such as variable scale objects, large intra-class differences, and imbalanced distribution among classes. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based models have been widely used in remote sensing image segmentation tasks for its powerful feature extraction capability. Due to intrinsic locality of CNN architectures, it is difficult to understand the long-range dependencies among image patches. Recently, the transformer leverages long-range dependencies and performs well in computer vision tasks. To take advantages of both CNN and Transformer, a novel Adaptive Enhanced Swin Transformer with U-Net (AESwin-UNet) is proposed for remote sensing segmentation. AESwin-UNet uses a hybrid Transformer-based U-type Encoder-Decoder architecture with skip connections to extract local and global semantic features. Specifically, the Enhanced Swin Transformer (E-Swin Transformer) contains Enhanced Multi-head Self-Attention and Deformable Adaptive Patch Merging layer in encoder. A symmetric cascaded decoder is designed for up-sampling to obtain higher resolution feature maps. Experiments on two public benchmark datasets, WHDLD and LoveDA, demonstrate that the proposed AESwin-UNet performs well in semantic segmentation.}
