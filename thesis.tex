\acknowledgements{I would like to express my gratitude to our mentor Dr. Loh Yuen Peng for her time and efforts he/she provided throughout the year. Your useful advice and suggestions were really helpful to me during the projectâ€™s completion. 

My parents as well as siblings that were constantly encouraging me throughout the process as they knew how much work went into this project so that is why I want to extend them thanks too!
